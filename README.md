## Music Transfer Script for Toyota Car Audio Systems
Welcome to the Music Transfer Script project! This script is designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of music from your computer's hard drive to a USB flash drive while preserving the order of file copying. This feature is especially crucial for vehicles manufactured by Toyota, as their audio systems rely on the file order for proper playback sequencing.

## Important Note
Please be aware that the script is programmed to automatically format the USB flash drive before transferring new music files. This ensures compatibility and optimal performance with your Toyota car audio system. Make sure to back up any important data from the flash drive before using it with this script.
